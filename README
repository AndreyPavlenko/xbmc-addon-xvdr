This is a PVR add-on for XBMC to add VDR (http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr) as a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It adds support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings, programming Timers and
EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or over the Network.

This add-on requires the installed "vdr-plugin-xvdr" plugin on the VDR server.
VDR itself doen't need any patches or modification to use all the current features.

VDR Versions older as 1.6.0 are not supported by this addon and the VDR plugin.
