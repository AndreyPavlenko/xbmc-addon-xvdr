------------------------------------------

This is a PVR add-on for XBMC to add VDR (http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr) as a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It adds support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings, programming Timers and
EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or over the Network.


------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

VDR itself doen't need any patches or modification to use all the current features.

* This add-on requires the installed "vdr-plugin-xvdr" plugin on the VDR server.
* For channel scanning you need the "wirbelscan" plugin (version >= 0.0.7) installed on
  the VDR server: http://wirbel.htpc-forum.de/wirbelscan/index2.html

Please activate the channel scanner via:
System / LiveTV / Client specific settings / XVDR Channel Scanner.

The current XBMC version (12.0) locks up on activating the channel scanner via the
standard system settings:
System / LiveTV / General / Search for channels

Please use the client specific setting.

VDR Versions older as 1.7.22 are not supported by this addon and the VDR plugin.
