------------------------------------------

This is a PVR add-on for XBMC to add VDR (http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr) as a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It adds support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings, programming Timers and
EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or over the Network.


------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

VDR itself doen't need any patches or modification to use all the current features.

* This add-on requires the installed "vdr-plugin-xvdr" plugin on the VDR server.
* For channel scanning you need the "wirbelscan" plugin (version >= 0.0.7) installed on
  the VDR server: http://wirbel.htpc-forum.de/wirbelscan/index2.html

Please activate the channel scanner via:
System / LiveTV / Client specific settings / XVDR Channel Scanner.

The current XBMC version (12.0) locks up on activating the channel scanner via the
standard system settings:
System / LiveTV / General / Search for channels

Please use the client specific setting.

VDR Versions older as 1.7.22 are not supported by this addon and the VDR plugin.


---------------------------------------------
BRANCHES

Unfortunately XBMC PVR ABI versions aren't backward compatible.
So we need to maintain different addon versions for XBMC.

Currently there are the following branches:

master        XBMC development version (currently 13)
xbmc-frodo    XBMC frodo (12.x)

Please check that you are using the correct addon version matching
your XBMC version !


---------------------------------------------
ADDON COMPILATION & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

IMPORTANT:
Please disable *all* PVR addons *before* installing the XVDR addon!

Currently only Linux is supported (but Windows versions should be possible).

- Clone the GIT repository
- cd xbmc-addon-xvdr
- sh autogen.sh
- ./configure --prefix=/usr/lib/xbmc (or $HOME/.xbmc)
- make
- make install

This will install the plugin into your /usr/lib/xbmc/addons or $HOME/.xbmc/addons directory

Have fun, ...
